  “The moon will never lie to anyone. Be like the moon. No one hates the moon 
  or wants to kill it. The moon does not take antidepressants and never gets 
  sent to prison. The moon never shot a guy in the face and ran away. The moon 
  has been around a long time and has never tried to rip anyone off. The moon 
  does not care who you want to touch or what color you are. The moon treats 
  everyone the same. The moon never tries to get in on the guest list or use 
  your name to impress others. Be like the moon. When others insult or belittle 
  in an attempt to elevate themselves, the moon sits passively and watches, 
  never lowering itself to anything that weak. The moon is beautiful and bright. 
  It needs no makeup to look beautiful. The moon never shoves clouds out of its 
  way so it can be seen. The moon needs not fame or money to be powerful. The 
  moon never asks you to go to war to defend it. Be like the moon.”

  Tom clapped his hands and cried: "Tom, Tom! Your guests are tired, and you had 
  near forgotten! Come now, my merry friends, and Tom will refresh you! You 
  shall clean grimy hands, and wash your weary faces; cast off your muddy cloaks 
  and comb out your tangles!" He opened the door, and they followed him down a 
  short passage and round a sharp turn. They came to a low room with a sloping 
  roof (a penthouse, it seemed, built on the north end of the house). Its walls 
  were of clean stone, but they were mostly covered with green hanging mats and 
  yellow curtains. The floor was flagged, and strewn with fresh green rushes. 
  There were four deep mattresses, each piled with white blankets, laid on the 
  floor along one side. Against the opposite wall was a long bench laden with 
  wide earthenware basins, and beside it stood brown ewers filled with water, 
  some cold, some steaming hot. There were soft green slippers set ready beside 
  each bed.

  Ultimately, this is not about solving your problems. It's about realizing 
  that there are no problems. Only situations - to be dealt with now, or to be 
  left alone and accepted as part of the "isness" of the present moment until 
  they change or can be dealt with.

  But what many people who have never formed a corporation don't know is that 
  a corporation is not really a thing. A corporation is merely a file folder 
  with some legal documents in it, sitting in some attorney's office and 
  registered with a state government agency. It's not a big building or a 
  factory or a group of people.
